Sample database dumps that can be used for the development purposes - to fill the database for basic functionality.

File names of the sample SQLs are indicate to the GIT hash they belong to.
If you want to load the SQL to the database, the best is to:
- checkout the specified GIT commit
- re-create the database using manage.py db recreate
- execute the SQL file against your database
- Then feel free to checkout latest commit and do `flask db upgrade` to migrate the structure to the latest version


# To create a new sample database dump, please use this command:
pg_dump -O -x -U USERNAME -h 127.0.0.1 DATABASENAME > CURRENT_COMMIT_HASH.sql
The -O and -x parameters are required to omit the SQL OWNER statements.

- in case of error:
 ERROR [root] Error: Multiple head revisions are present for given argument 'head'; please specify a specific target revision, '<branchname>@head' to narrow to a specific head, or 'heads' for all heads

$ flask db merge heads
$ flask db upgrade

and please commit the latest migrations script to the repo.
